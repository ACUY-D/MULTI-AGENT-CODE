## Migration Guides

### Migrating from 0.9.x to 1.0.0

#### Breaking Changes

1. **Configuration Format**
   ```json
   // Old (0.9.x)
   {
     "agents": {
       "model_name": "gpt-4"
     }
   }
   
   // New (1.0.0)
   {
     "agents": {
       "architect": {
         "model": "gpt-4"
       }
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Tool Names**
   ```typescript
   // Old (0.9.x)
   await executeTool('run_orchestrator', params);
   
   // New (1.0.0)
   await executeTool('orchestrator.run', params);
   ```

3. **API Changes**
   - `Pipeline.execute()` now returns `Promise<PipelineResult>`
   - `Agent.process()` renamed to `Agent.execute()`
   - Resource URIs changed from `mcp://` to `orchestrator://`

#### Migration Steps

1. Update configuration files to new format
2. Update tool invocations to use new names
3. Update resource URI references
4. Run migration script: `npx mcp-orchestrator migrate`
5. Test thoroughly before deploying

### Migrating from 0.8.x to 0.9.x

1. Update TypeScript to version 5.x
2. Update all import statements to use `.js` extensions
3. Refactor agent implementations to extend `BaseAgent`
4. Update test files to use Vitest instead of Jest

## Deprecations

### Deprecated in 1.0.0
- `Pipeline.run()` - Use `Pipeline.execute()` instead
- `Agent.process()` - Use `Agent.execute()` instead
- `mcp://` URI scheme - Use `orchestrator://` instead

### Removed in 1.0.0
- Legacy JavaScript support (TypeScript only)
- Callback-based APIs (Promise/async only)
- Global configuration object
- Synchronous file operations
