## Security Measures

### Current Security Features

- API key validation for all tool executions
- JWT token support for session management
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Rate limiting per API key

#### 🛡️ Data Protection
- Environment variable encryption for sensitive data
- No storage of API keys in logs or artifacts
- Secure handling of user credentials
- Input sanitization and validation

#### 🔒 Communication Security
- HTTPS/TLS support for HTTP mode
- Secure WebSocket connections (WSS)
- Certificate validation
- CORS policy enforcement

#### 📝 Audit & Monitoring
- Comprehensive audit logging
- Anomaly detection for unusual patterns
- Security event tracking
- Real-time alerts for critical events

### Security Best Practices

#### For Users

1. **API Key Management**
   ```bash
   # ✅ Good: Use environment variables
   export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
   
   # ❌ Bad: Hardcode in files
   const apiKey = "sk-..."
   ```

2. **Configuration Security**
   ```json
   {
     "security": {
       "apiKeys": {
         "storage": "environment",
         "encryption": true
       }
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Network Security**
   - Always use HTTPS in production
   - Implement proper firewall rules
   - Use VPN for sensitive operations
   - Enable rate limiting

4. **Access Control**
   - Use least privilege principle
   - Rotate API keys regularly
   - Enable 2FA where possible
   - Monitor access logs

#### For Developers

1. **Code Security**
   ```typescript
   // ✅ Good: Validate and sanitize input
   const sanitized = validator.escape(userInput);
   
   // ❌ Bad: Direct use of user input
   eval(userInput);
   ```

2. **Dependency Management**
   ```bash
   # Regular security audits
   npm audit
   pnpm audit --fix
   
   # Check for known vulnerabilities
   npx audit-ci --moderate
   ```

3. **Secret Management**
   - Never commit secrets to version control
   - Use `.env.example` for templates
   - Implement secret scanning in CI/CD
   - Use dedicated secret management tools

4. **Error Handling**
   ```typescript
   // ✅ Good: Generic error messages
   throw new Error('Authentication failed');
   
   // ❌ Bad: Exposing sensitive information
   throw new Error(`Invalid API key: ${apiKey}`);
   ```

## Security Checklist

## Known Security Considerations

### AI Model Interactions

⚠️ **Important**: AI models can potentially be manipulated through prompt injection.

**Mitigations:**
- Input sanitization before sending to models
- Output validation after receiving responses
- Strict prompt templates
- Regular prompt security audits

### Third-Party Integrations

⚠️ **Important**: External services introduce additional attack surface.

**Mitigations:**
- Validate all external service responses
- Use secure communication protocols
- Implement timeout and retry limits
- Monitor third-party service health

### File System Operations

⚠️ **Important**: File operations can lead to path traversal attacks.

**Mitigations:**
- Strict path validation
- Sandbox execution environment
- Limited file system permissions
- Regular permission audits

## Security Headers

For HTTP mode, ensure these headers are configured:

```javascript
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  res.setHeader('X-Content-Type-Options', 'nosniff');
  res.setHeader('X-Frame-Options', 'DENY');
  res.setHeader('X-XSS-Protection', '1; mode=block');
  res.setHeader('Strict-Transport-Security', 'max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains');
  res.setHeader('Content-Security-Policy', "default-src 'self'");
  res.setHeader('Referrer-Policy', 'no-referrer');
  res.setHeader('Permissions-Policy', 'geolocation=(), microphone=(), camera=()');
  next();
});
```
